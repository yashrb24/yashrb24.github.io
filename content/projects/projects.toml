Real-time detection of 263 classes from the INCLUDE dataset on resource-constrained edge devices. Experimented with BiLSTMs and Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks to replace the heavy MobileNet encoders used in their paper. Achieved ~88% accuracy while significantly reducing parameter count. Currently integrating the model into a mobile app; preparing for conference submission

Standard VLMs like CLIP struggle to differentiate between correct and incorrect object counts. Conducted a rigorous reproducibility study of the "CountCLIP" method and proposed a Multi-Class Counting Loss and adaptive hyperparameter tuning to mitigate overfitting on frequent classes. Achieved 28.88% accuracy (vs 27.5% baseline) on the CountBench benchmark. Released cleaned codebase and repaired evaluation benchmark to the open-source community.

Default striping configurations in parallel file systems lead to significant I/O performance drops and imbalanced data distribution across storage targets. We built a cluster-aware adaptive framework that analyzes historical application logs (e.g., Darshan) to derive optimal striping parameters. We use a syscall interceptor that captures runtime file operations and dynamically enforces the calculated striping configurations via the striping API provided by the file system.. Code out soon!

Developed a monocular visual servoing system for autonomous navigation using a custom trained YOLOv3 for object detection. Used A* algorithm to determine the path to the target location using depth heatmaps from Zed2i camera. Implemented a PID-controlled GPS navigation system using RTK, enabling precise rover traversal between nearby local coordinates. We stood second in the Autonomous task at International Rover Challenge 2023!

RSPNBench is a deep dive into making database query optimization smarter using tractable probabilistic models. Instead of relying on basic, often-inaccurate histograms, I implemented RSPNs from scratch in C++ and Java. It uses Randomized Dependence Coefficients (RDC) to sniff out non-linear correlations between columns and then recursively breaks the data down using K-Means++ clustering. Under the hood, it’s a hierarchical tree of Sum and Product nodes that can handle complex range queries and cardinality estimation in O(height of tree) time. Got to play around with the Eigen library (C++) for the numerical algorithms
